 <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-694737364-518467920/the-journey-breathing-techniques" target="_blank">The Journey</a> is a relaxation technique 
    based upon a new learning approach developed to raise awareness of the human paradox of forgetting. 
</p>
<p>           
    Learning is an ongoing sensory process waiting to unfold as an individually unique story.  Judge Wendell Holmes said <i>"Words are not crystal, 
    transparent and unchanged, they are the skin of living thought and vary in colour and content according to the circumstances and time in which they’re used”.</i>
</p>
<p>  
  We’re all on a journey travelling through time, space and forces and as you’re listening to the reader’s voice going up and octave and then down 
  you relax.  
</p>
<p>  
   As you’re thinking over earlier sensory memories and as I sit at my desk thinking surely the science of psychology remembers 
  the metaphorical character of life events are expressed in picturesand is a common language and is the only way people know how to express themselves, 
  which is often misinterpreted.
</p>
<p>  
  Napoleon Bonaparte said a picture is worth a thousand words and all my students, young and older clients and patients referred as we work together 
  on what’s thought to be problems, I say your head is just like a filing cabinet that gets cluttered with all kinds of rubbish and its time to leave 
  some space for learning something new.  
</p>
<p>      
My students are told that the human brain and body works on two levels sensory and physical and works in 
  synchronicity together and your body is just like a steam engine puffing its way along and to make sure you stay on track, and occasionally you have 
  to pause and check out your breathing. 
</p>
<p>  
My name is Kerryanne Llewellyn and in my professional opinion most problems in life arise from inability to engage with others from this habitual 
cycle of tension and this affects ways you think and what you do.  The Journey is a relaxation technique for you to experience breathing deeply and 
relaxing, bringing oxygen and energy to every pulsating cell inside your body.
</p>
<p>  
Have you ever felt as if you live between two worlds, an inner sensory world that’s intuitively true to you, as sometimes you transcend reviving 
sensory memories of a life so perfect that surely nothing else exists.
</p>
<p>  
 Other times as you’re trying to familiarise yourself with types of words used to engage with others you stop breathing anxiety arises from pressure, 
 tension builds inside your body as you forget you’ve stopped breathing, you feel vulnerable fearful as you don’t know what’s going wrong. You begin 
  to hyperventilate and panic taking in too much oxygen by mouth, gas exchanges inside your body changes increasing carbon dioxide in your 
 blood, oxygen levels drop and high concentrations lead to inflammatory systemic problems, headaches, stomach problems, flu like symptoms, 
    problems affecting your heart, and other major organs inside the body.  
 </p>
<p>     
   This is not a personal failure its an educational and worldwide health problem.
</p>
<p>  
This is for you to learn new ways of relaxing, releasing tension from our body by focusing on breathing rhythmically remembering your earlier 
 memories embedded within you as a reference point, reminding you of your most powerfully advanced leadership means offing able to pause, 
think for a second and breathe deeply before socially or professionally engaging with others, improving your health, life now and your future outcomes.
