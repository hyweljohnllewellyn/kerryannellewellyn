 <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-694737364-518467920/the-journey-breathing-techniques" target="_blank">The Journey</a> is a relaxation technique 
    based upon a new learning approach developed to raise awareness of the human paradox of forgetting. 
</p>
<p>           
    Learning is an ongoing sensory process waiting to unfold as an individually unique story. 
	Judge Wendell Holmes said 
	<i>"A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according 
		to the circumstances and time in which it is used.”</i>
</p>
<p>  
  We’re all on a journey travelling through time and space, and as you’re listening to the reader’s voice going up and octave and then down, 
  you relax.  
</p>
<p>  
   As you’re thinking over earlier sensory memories and as I sit at my desk thinking surely the science of psychology remembers 
  the metaphorical character of life events are expressed in pictures and is a common language and is the only way people know how to express themselves, 
  which is often misinterpreted.
</p>
<p>  
	Napoleon Bonaparte said <i>@a picture is worth a thousand words"</i> and all my students, young and older clients and patients referred as we work together 
  on what’s thought to be problems, I say your head is just like a filing cabinet that gets cluttered with all kinds of rubbish and its time to leave 
  some space for learning something new.  
</p>
<p>      
My students are told that the human brain and body works on two levels sensory and physical and works in 
  synchronicity together.  
</p>
<p> 	
 <b>Your body is just like a steam engine puffing its way along. To make sure you stay on track, occasionally you have 
to pause and check your breathing.</b>
</p>
<p>  
My name is Kerryanne Llewellyn and in my professional opinion most problems in life arise from inability to engage with others from this habitual 
cycle of tension and this affects ways you think and what you do.  
</p>
<p>  
The Journey is a relaxation technique for you to experience breathing deeply, 
relaxing, bringing oxygen and energy to every pulsating cell inside your body.
</p>
<p>  
Have you ever felt as if you live between two worlds, an inner sensory world that’s intuitively true to you, as you transcend reviving 
sensory memories of a life so perfect that surely nothing else exists.
</p>
<p>  
 Other times as you’re processing what you are seeing you often feel anxious or excluded and the same thing happens as you are assessing 
	unfamiliar sounding language, or words used, you doubt or become confused, you stop breathing anxiety arises from pressure, 
 tension builds and you panic. You begin 
  to hyperventilate oxygen levels in your bloods stream drop and high concentrations of carbon dioxide leads to inflammatory  problems,
	affecting your physical body.  
 </p>
<p>     
    This is not a personal failure, it is an educational and worldwide health problem.
</p>
<p>  
This Journey is designed for you to learn new ways of relaxing, releasing tension from your body by focusing on breathing rhythmically
	and remembering that your earlier experiences leave you with memories embedded within you as a reference point, 
	to your most powerfully advanced leadership means of being able to pause, 
think for a second and breathe deeply before socially or professionally engaging with others.
	Improving your health, life now and future outcomes.
  </p>    
<p>  
	<b>So let's begin</b>
 </p>    
<p>  
Before you undertake this journey, you must first check your breathing.  
What about your engine, your body...
</p>    
<p> 	    
To change down.
 </p>    
<p>  	    
Go into relaxation mode and make a commitment, 
you are responsible for your actions.
If you’re not prepared, 
delay your journey.  
Take your time, 
Listen to your breathing.  
Are you ready.
To change down 
you need to choose, 
are you feeling vulnerable, confident or strong.  
You can choose 
You are judge jury and participant.
On your last journey you weren’t prepared.  
 </p>    
<p>  
Now you’re in control.  
	Remember relax.
 </p>    
<p>  
Breathe in slowly, up through your nose, pushing your lower stomach out for five, then out slowly through your tunnelled mouth for ten.  
Now relax.  
Again.  
Breathe in-slowly up through your nose, pushing your lower body out for five.  Then let our breathe out slowly through your tunnelled mouth for ten.
Relax.  
Now you’re on the second stage.  
 </p>    
<p>  
Check your breathing.
 </p>    
<p>  
Again breathe in slowly up through your nose, pushing your lower body out for ten. Then out slowly for fifteen.  
</p>    
<p>Now Relax.</p>    
<p>  
You are an independent person in your own right and choice of direction is entirely up to you.  
</p>    
<p>  Just remember continue breathing rhythmically.
